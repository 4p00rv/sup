    <h1>Welcome to S'UP at <%= ENV['COMPANY_NAME'] %>, <%= @member.name %></h1>
    <p>
      You're now a part of <%= ENV['COMPANY_NAME_POSSESSIVE'] %> weekly casual cross-team three-person-group stand-up.

    <div class="section-title">What's S'UP?</div>
    <p>
      S'UP is an easy way to stay up-to-date with what's going on at <%= ENV['COMPANY_NAME'] %> outside of your own projects. It's also a great way to chat with folks on the team you might not get a chance to interact with on a daily basis. Once a week, 20 minutes, at your convenience.
    </p>
    <div class="section-title">----</div>
    <div class="section-title">What's Next?</div>
    <ol>
      <li>Look out for an email each Sunday with two other folds at <%= ENV['COMPANY_NAME'] %> on different teams than your own.</li>
      <li>Together, choose an open time on your calendars to meet that week for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Get together and go around briefly talking about one thing you're focused on these days.</li>
    </ol>

      <p>What you'd like to discuss, and how you would like to show/describe it is up to you. Some helpful tips to discussing a project with 2 people who may not have full context:</p>

        <li>What is it?</li>
        <li>Why is it relevant, interesting, or beneficial to <%= ENV['COMPANY_NAME'] %>?</li>
        <li>What's been challenging about it (or an anticipated challenge)?</li>
        <li>What would you consider a successful outcome for it?</li>
