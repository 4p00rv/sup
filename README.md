S'up is short for (informal and interdisciplinary) standup, and xtal is short for crystal. Hopefully, S'up will help people form connections with their colleagues that they normally aren't nearby or working with, creating a lattice of connections throughout a whole un-fragmented Artsy, like the atoms in a single crystal.
