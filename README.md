About
---

S'up is short for (informal and interdisciplinary) standup, and xtal is short for crystal. Hopefully, S'up will help people form connections with their colleagues that they normally aren't nearby or working with, creating a lattice of connections throughout a whole un-fragmented Artsy, like the atoms in a single crystal.

TODO
---

* Refactoring
    * break the logic of organizing triplets outside of the Meeting model, perhaps making the used "ranks" hash into an object of its own
* Features
    * Probe user's calendars, and recommend meeting times
    * Check in during the S'up meeting to log who made it
